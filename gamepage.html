          <p>You are in Newcastle castle.
            The knights are seated at the round table and are waiting for your magnificient speech.</p>
          <p>Press the thumbs up to enter the main hall</p>
          <div id="hall">
            <p>You enter the hall to see a crowd of knights, ladies and lords. The king of England has issued a decree
              to rescue the kingdom from the hands of the ememy.
              He needs every warrior to defend their city and town.
            </p>
            <p>
              Do you eloquently explain that bravery is overated and the king is overeracting, claiming he is merely
              drunk and delusional.
              <br>or...
              Do you majestically sound the trumpet and exhort your knights to defend Newcastle at all costs?
