## Rationale
The idea is simple. The user chooses how the story begins and ends with a series of twists and turns along the way. Using various javascript methods to achieve this, 
the game will be fully interactive with buttons and images to be revealed depending on which options are chosen. 

### Extra features
To add sound effects hidden in a loop or even music would be an extra bonus.
